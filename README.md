📘 Content Management System (CMS)

Overview
This Content Management System (CMS) is designed to streamline operations for businesses that manage products, rentals, and online storefronts.
Originally built for a decor rental company, the system supports rental orders and product management. With minimal adjustments, it can be converted to support retail businesses that sell items directly.
The CMS provides a centralized platform to manage product details, company information, and website visuals, ensuring efficiency and consistency across business operations.
